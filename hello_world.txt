Adding some text to this. This is FUN! I love coding!
Learning how to code might be a path forward
for my life!
It will take some time, but with consistency,
I might be able to be a programmer making a 
good salary one day!

That's the goal. Just stay consistent. Keep
that beating heart locked on the prize.
